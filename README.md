## Transcriptomic analysis of human monocytes for breast cancer diagnosis


### Background and motivation 

Breast and endometrial cancer are two of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in women in the UK. There is increasing evidence that early detection of tumours improves survival rates. Mammography is the most accurate and non-invasive method to date for early detection of breast cancer, however its efficacy drops in women with higher breast density, resulting in overdiagnosis and potentially unnecessary interventions (Kolb et al. 2002). Currently there is no available screening method for early detection of endometrial cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a non-invasive method for early detection of breast and endometrial cancer. 
The advent of high-throughput microarray technologies has resulted in an increased interest in identification of multigene signatures for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) have been shown to be a promising source of diagnostic biomarkers in several cancer types, including breast cancer (Sharma et al. 2005; Aar√∏e et al. 2010a; LaBreche et al. 2011; Dumeaux et al. 2014). However, PBMCs represent a heterogeneous cell population, presenting with pro-tumoral and anti-tumoral functions. Hence, it might be more informative to study individual cell types. Monocytes are circulating blood cells that migrate to tissues and give rise to macrophages. Recent studies have revealed a pro-tumoral profile for these cells in renal carcinoma and colorectal cancer (Chittezhath et al. 2014; Hamm et al. 2015). 
Consequently, this study investigated the transcriptomes of circulating monocytes in breast and endometrial cancer in order to develop a blood-based, non-invasive diagnostic test for the detection of cancer. This test would act as a clinical tool for efficient screening of patients at risk. 

### Project Aims 
a)	To compare the transcriptional profiles of circulating monocytes coming from breast and endometrial cancer patients to healthy individuals as well as between cancer types.
b)	To identify a diagnostic signature and develop a classification model for stratification of cancer patients.
c)	To validate the robustness of the diagnostic signature on independent patient cohorts as well as datasets of monocytes from different cancer types.
